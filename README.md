## :wrench: Manage

To manage users and images, simply navigate to the admin section and access the admin panel. I continuously working on improving this panel. In the meantime, you can easily manage files and folders within the admin section.

You can install ArtCODE as progressive webapp.

Please note that in order to run the sqlite database, you will need to install the sqlite database extension. If you are using xampp, you can do this by accessing the xampp control panel, clicking on "config," selecting "php.ini," and searching for the sqlite extension. Don't forget to remove the semicolon to enable the extension.
