                      <p>
                        Once in the upload section, carefully choose the images you want to upload. You can typically do this by using a file picker or a drag-and-drop interface.

                        After selecting your images, click the upload button. This will prompt you to fill in any necessary forms or information related to the uploaded images, such as titles, descriptions, or categories.

                        Be aware that there might be limitations on the number of images you can upload, such as a maximum of 20 images. If you need to add more images to an existing collection, visit <a class="text-decoration-none link-dark fw-bold" href="/edit/upload.php" target="_blank">upload new images</a> and follow the steps to append new images to the current image ID.
